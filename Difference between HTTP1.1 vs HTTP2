HTTP/1.1
1. Year - 1997
2. It supports connection reuse i.e. for every TCP connection there could be multiple requests and responses, and pipelining where the client can request several resources from the server at once.
3. Introduces a warning header field to carry additional information about the status of a message. Can define 24 status codes, error reporting is quicker and more efficient.
4. It is relatively secure since it uses digest authentication, NTLM authentication.
5. Expands on the caching support by using additional headers like cache-control, conditional headers like If-Match and by using entity tags.


HTTP/2
1. Year - 2015
2. Uses multiplexing, where over a single TCP connection resources to be delivered are interleaved and arrive at the client almost at the same time.
3. Security concerns from previous versions will continue to be seen in HTTP/2. However, it is better equipped to deal with them due to new TLS features like connection error of type Inadequate_Security.
4. HTTP/2 does not change much in terms of caching. With the server push feature if the client finds the resources are already present in the cache, it can cancel the pushed stream.
5. HTTP/2 utilizes multiplexing and server push to effectively reduce the page load time by a greater margin along with being less sensitive to network delays.
