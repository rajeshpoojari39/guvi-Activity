Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript.
Ojects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
Example var Person = {
                      firstName: "Rajesh",
                      lastName: "Poojari,
        }
We access Object properties using . dot operator. If I need to access firstName , then I use Person.firstName it will give me Rajesh.
We can also create objects like this as well-
var myCar = new Object();
myCar.make = 'Ford';
myCar.model = 'Mustang';
myCar.year = 1969;

if we console.log(myCar); it will give us this -
{
  make: "Ford",
  model: "Mustang",
  year: "1969",
}
